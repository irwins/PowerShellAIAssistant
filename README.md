## Notice of Repository Closure

This repository is now closed. I have moved it to a new home to better serve its needs and continue development. 

Thank you for your support and collaboration!

The new repository includes key updates from the latest OpenAI announcements. Please visit [PSAI](https://github.com/dfinke/PSAI) to stay updated and contribute.

Welcome to `PowerShell AI Assistant`, a module designed for seamless integration with `OpenAI Assistant` APIs, providing a rich set of functionalities to empower your PowerShell scripts with the latest AI technologies. Dive into an enhanced scripting experience by leveraging an AI-powered assistant in your console.

## Why PowerShell AI Assistant?

`PowerShell AI Assistant` is where advanced AI meets PowerShell scripting. With this module, you can create interactive, intelligent scripts and applications that understand and process natural language with ease.

<!-- ## Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `Get-OAIAssistant` requires PowerShell 7.4 or higher. It needs the `AllowInsecureRedirect` parameter, a workaround is being investigated.

If you don't have PowerShell 7.4 or higher, you can use CodeSpaces to run the example. Click the button below to open CodeSpaces. -->

</a>

## Install

> **Note**: If you have `PowerShellAI` you can safely `PowerShellAIAssistant` using `-AllowClobber`

```powershell
Install-Module PowerShellAIAssistant -AllowClobber
```

## Configure

1. Create an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) or [sign in](https://platform.openai.com/login).
2. Navigate to the [API key page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
3. Click "Create new secret key", optionally naming the key. Make sure to save this somewhere safe and do not share it with anyone.
4. Set the environment variable `OpenAIKey` to your API key.
5. Open a new PowerShell and type `$ENV:OpenAIKey`. If you do not see your API key, you may need to either restart your computer or use a script like [Refresh-EnvironmentVariables](https://github.com/asheroto/Refresh-EnvironmentVariables) for it to be detected.
6. Run the [Sanity-Check](/examples/Sanity-Check.ps1) script, which will create and delete an assistant on OpenAI to confirm it's working. If it works, you're good to go.

## Examples

There is one example and it is in a Polyglot Interactive Notebook titled [Assistants API overview](examples/Assistants_API_overview.ipynb). This notebook shows how to use the Assistants API to build a simple question answering interaction.

## Support for Azure OpenAI 

After creating an [Azure OpenAI resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal), you can use the `PowerShellAIAssistant` module to interact with it. 

You need to get the following secrets form the Azure Portal and Azure AI Studio - `apiURI`,`apiVersion`,`apiKey`,`deploymentName`.

```powershell
$secrets = @{
    apiURI         = "<Your Azure OpenAI API URI>"
    apiVersion     = "<Your Azure OpenAI API Version>"
    apiKey         = "<Your Azure OpenAI API Key>"
    deploymentName = "<Your Azure OpenAI Deployment Name>"
}

Set-OAIProvider AzureOpenAI
Set-AzOAISecrets @secrets
```

See: [Simple-Tutor-Azure-OpenAI.ps1](examples/Simple-Tutor-Azure-OpenAI.ps1)

A `Set-OAIProvider` and `Get-OAIProvider` function are available to switch between OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.
